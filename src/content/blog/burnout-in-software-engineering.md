Being a software engineer can be quite tiring. Some software developers have left or lost their jobs as a result of stress. Honestly, I can relate to feeling tired of it sometimes. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry can often leave us feeling overwhelmed.

While I may not be an expert in mental health, my personal experiences have highlighted the significance of recognizing and dealing with stress. It's really important to have open discussions about burnout, setting priorities, and recognizing early warning signs. This way, we can manage it promptly and effectively.

> According to [isolved's 2024 HR Trends Survey](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/employees-are-still-burnt-out-isolveds-2024-hr-trends-survey-finds-65-of-employees-are-suffering-from-burnout-302017336.html), a staggering 65% of employees are suffering from burnout. This statistic underscores the widespread prevalence of burnout in today's workplaces, affecting employees across various industries.

## Recognizing the Symptoms

Burnout is described by the World Health Organization as _"a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion due to long-term and excessive stress."_ I decided to reach out to my colleagues and ask them about their experiences with burnout. Some common symptoms include feeling tired all the time, being easily angered, or feeling irritable.

A lot of coworkers have been complaining about their work environment. They say that their bosses care more about how things look than the actual quality of the work. Working from home can be a great way to reduce stress because it allows you to escape the constant demand for your attention. Working remotely can sometimes result in feelings of isolation and disconnection from your work.

## My Recent Experience with Remote Work

Recently, I've been realizing that I struggle to find motivation when I'm working from the office. I'm experiencing some burnout symptoms, like feeling bored and lacking motivation to put in my best effort to complete my tasks. I really disliked being in the office, surrounded by people. I've made the choice to work from home one day a week.

How did it go? Any results? Great! I had a surprisingly positive experience and was able to work and concentrate effectively! To be honest, I didn't spend a full 8 hours in front of my laptop, but I still managed to accomplish more than I would have at the office. Surprisingly, I didn't mind working at all. I got a lot done.

For me, being more productive is all about getting more work done in less time, rather than just doing the same or less during an 8-hour workday. I even spent a couple of hours working from a coffee shop (I have to confess, I may have checked [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dusan-todorovic-krcky/) a few times, oops) and it was a blast! With my noise cancellation air pods, I can stay focused and undisturbed!

## Causes of Burnout: Overwork

Multitasking can leave you fatigued and overwhelmed. Understand the value of asking for help and managing your time. Lack of workers might cause task overload. To ensure everyone is on the same page, communicate with coworkers and managers. Regular breaks and job sharing help manage workloads and avoid burnout. Lastly, prioritize chores and focus on what matters.

### Lack of Control

When we can't influence larger initiatives or alter things, it's stressful and discouraging. When coworkers oppose change, productivity suffers. To improve teamwork, we must address this issue. Managers should aggressively encourage staff to communicate their thoughts and be open to new ideas. Managers must also promote trust and respect.

### Low Appreciation

It can be really discouraging and tiring when your hard work goes unnoticed. It's really important to value and acknowledge everyone's contributions. Getting recognized and praised by others can be really helpful. Encouraging employees to share their successes with their colleagues is wonderful. It's important for employers to give their workers chances to develop and push themselves.

### Poor Workplace Relations

Supervisors and coworkers might argue, causing workplace friction and harmful conditions. Every employee should feel encouraged and valued at work. Employers should foster open communication and teamwork in a healthy, supportive workplace. Having policies and processes to quickly and equitably resolve issues would be useful. Finally, firms must equip workers to manage stress and emotions.

### Mismatched Values

Employees in a company that doesn't share your beliefs might feel alone and unhappy. Your well-being depends on finding an organization that shares your beliefs. Finding a career that supports and values your viewpoint is vital. A nice work atmosphere boosts job satisfaction and demonstrates a corporation appreciates its employees. To be happy in your profession, you must select a company that shares your values.

## How long does burnout last?

If left unattended, burnout can persist for extended periods of time, ranging from weeks to months or even years. It's important to take action as soon as you notice signs of stress to prevent them from getting worse. Dealing with early intervention is similar to taking care of any other health concern-the sooner you take action, the better it is!

## Burnout vs. Depression

It's common for people to confuse burnout with sadness because they both leave individuals feeling exhausted, irritable, and powerless. Often, excessive stress in the workplace can result in burnout. However, depression can be triggered by various factors and may require assistance from a professional. Skilled help can improve both conditions.

Addressing work-related stress may not immediately alleviate burnout. It's crucial to prioritize your well-being and allow yourself time to heal, especially when facing work-related challenges. Getting counseling from a mental health worker can be really helpful for individuals who are struggling with depression and burnout. It can make a big difference in how they cope with their issues and find effective solutions.

## Preventing Burnout

Taking some simple steps can help you avoid burnout, even if you're not experiencing any stress symptoms. It's really important to take care of yourself and find ways to reduce stress for the sake of your mental health. By establishing clear boundaries, using stress management techniques, and reaching out for professional help when needed, you can avoid burnout. Meeting with a counselor on a regular basis can be really helpful in dealing with stress and taking care of your mental well-being.

### Practical Tips for Individuals

1.  Establishing Limits: Make sure you have a clear schedule for your work hours and stick to it. Try to avoid working late or on weekends if you can.
2.  Remember to take breaks. Taking regular breaks throughout the day can be beneficial for maintaining productivity and reducing stress.
3.  Focus on important tasks and consider delegating when you can. Consider using tools such as to-do lists or project management apps.
4.  Try incorporating mindfulness into your routine. Give techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga a shot to help keep your stress levels in check.
5.  Remember to reach out for support if you're feeling overwhelmed. Talking to a counselor or mental health professional can be really helpful.
6.  Spice things up: Discover something new at home and give it a shot at work to keep things exciting.

### Helpful Suggestions for Organizations

1.  Encourage open communication: Make sure employees feel comfortable expressing their concerns and giving feedback on a regular basis.
2.  Show appreciation: Make sure to acknowledge the efforts and achievements of your employees to keep them motivated.
3.  Offer access to mental health resources, like counseling services or stress management workshops, to provide support.
4.  Encourage a healthy work-life balance by introducing policies that allow for flexible working hours and the option to work remotely.

## How It Affects the Team

Burnout has an impact on both the individual and the team. When someone experiences burnout, it can have a negative impact on team morale, productivity, and the overall harmony of the workplace. It's important for organizations to be aware of the signs of burnout among their employees and to take action to provide support.

I'm still recovering from the impact of burnout caused by a former colleague who is no longer with us. We have made efforts to assist them by providing them with ample time and choices to recuperate and come back to work with a more effective approach. Instead, they chose not to do any of that and simply continued to remain in that state of being unresponsive. However, one day, they made an inappropriate comment towards me, which ultimately led us to mutually decide to end our collaboration.

Unfortunately, they are no longer employed by the company, which has left my team with incomplete tasks and code of subpar quality. So, what can we learn from this? When you start experiencing symptoms, it's important to take action rapidly to take care of yourself. Maybe it's not always the company's fault, but sometimes it's just a matter of not having the motivation to help yourself.

## My Frustrations

In my opinion, the current system of working eight hours a day is fundamentally flawed. This expectation really frustrates me a lot.

Moreover, receiving tasks without enough or incomplete information can lead to unnecessary stress. It can be frustrating to have to keep asking for clarifications that should have been given from the start.

Not having enough information can also result in errors and confusion, which can be even more frustrating. It's important to make sure employees have the information they need and think about all the different situations where this task might come up. With this, they can get their tasks done quickly and efficiently.

Sharing and talking about these experiences can have a therapeutic effect. It emphasizes the significance of relying on someone and seeking professional assistance when necessary. It's generally not a good idea to complain about colleagues while on the job, but talking to a psychologist can offer helpful advice for dealing with challenging situations.

Just a friendly reminder that you're never alone. Getting assistance from a professional can be extremely helpful when you're going through challenging periods. If you take steps to address your issues and seek support, you can unlock a brighter and more fulfilling future.

## Conclusion

It's really important to make sure that employees don't get burned out at work. This is not only good for their well-being but also for the success of the organization as a whole. It's important for employers to focus on fostering a friendly and supportive work atmosphere. They should make sure that the company's values are in line with those of their employees and offer resources to help manage stress. It's important to address issues early on and take care of yourself.
