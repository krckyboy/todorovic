## Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences in web development with you.

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that focuses on shipping less JavaScript and providing an excellent developer experience.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development** - Tips, tutorials, and best practices
- **Technology** - My thoughts on the latest trends
- **Projects** - Sharing what I'm working on

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for this blog because:

1. **Performance** - Astro ships zero JavaScript by default
2. **Content-focused** - Perfect for blogs with Content Collections
3. **Developer Experience** - Great tooling and fast builds
4. **Flexibility** - Can integrate with React, Vue, or stay pure HTML

## Stay Tuned

I'll be posting regularly about my journey in software development. Feel free to reach out through the social links in the footer!

Thanks for reading!
