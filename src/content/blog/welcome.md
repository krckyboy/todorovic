## Why I Rebuilt It

The previous version of my site served me well, but it mixed content and implementation decisions in ways that made future updates slower than they should be.

I wanted a cleaner foundation with:

- Better performance by default
- Clear module boundaries in the codebase
- A workflow that keeps requirements explicit before implementation

That is why this new version is built with Astro and organized around practical architecture conventions.

## Built with AI + OpenSpec

This rebuild was strongly supported by AI-assisted engineering, especially during exploration, refactors, and consistency checks.

The key difference is that AI output is not treated as source of truth. OpenSpec is.

For non-trivial work, I use a spec-first loop:

1. Define the proposal and expected behavior
2. Capture decisions and tradeoffs in design artifacts
3. Implement against explicit tasks
4. Validate before handoff

This keeps development fast without sacrificing clarity.

## What You Can Expect Here

I will continue sharing posts about:

- Front-end engineering and architecture
- Team leadership lessons from real projects
- AI-assisted engineering workflows
- Spec-driven delivery with practical examples

## What Is Next

The immediate roadmap for this site includes:

- Final SEO and metadata alignment per route
- Per-post Open Graph image generation
- Deployment readiness and controlled domain cutover

If you are reading this, the new foundation is live and moving forward.

Thanks for being here.
