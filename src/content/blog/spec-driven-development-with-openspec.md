## Working Title

[Write your opening hook here: what problem pushed you toward spec-driven development?]

## Why I Needed This

[Write your real context: team/project pressure, AI speed vs quality, where things used to break.]

## What OpenSpec Changed for Me

[Explain your actual workflow and what became better. Keep this practical.]

Suggested points:

- Proposals before implementation
- Explicit design decisions
- Task-level execution and tracking
- Fewer surprises during review/deploy

## How AI Fits In (Codex)

[Describe your Codex workflow with examples from this repo.]

## Concrete Example

[Pick one real change and show: intent -> proposal -> tasks -> implementation -> validation.]

## Lessons Learned

[Capture what you would repeat and what you would change next time.]

## Closing

[Add your final perspective and what readers should do next.]
