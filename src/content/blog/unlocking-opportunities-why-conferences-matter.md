## Overview

I recently attended JSHeroes 2024 in Cluj, Romania, and want to share why attending web development conferences provides substantial value. At 150 euros, the event provided meals, snacks, and high-quality technical content.

## Key Reasons to Attend Conferences

### Networking Opportunities

Conferences unite professionals across industries. I recommend approaching speakers during breaks to discuss their presentations and connect on social media. Even shy attendees can reach out online afterward without fear of rejection.

### Learning from Industry Experts

Conferences feature presentations from renowned professionals sharing cutting-edge knowledge. For example, a Playwright talk by Debbie O'Brien from Microsoft influenced my team's testing approach significantly.

### Motivation and Energy

Being surrounded by passionate technologists reignites enthusiasm and encourages pushing boundaries in your own work. There's something special about being in a room full of people who share your passion.

### Cultural Exploration

Attending conferences in new cities adds personal growth through experiencing different cultures and cuisines. It's a great excuse to explore somewhere new!

## Practical Tip

Take detailed notes during talks, including speaker website links for follow-up research. You'll thank yourself later when you want to dive deeper into a topic.

## Standout Talks from JSHeroes 2024

Here are some presentations that stood out to me:

1. **Rose Akoth** - Demonstrated logical CSS properties for multilingual, accessible web design
2. **Tejas Kumar** - Explored the expanding definition of AI engineering beyond traditional roles
3. **Bramus Van Damme** - Explained MPA View Transitions as an emerging web development feature

## Conclusion

If you've been on the fence about attending a conference, I encourage you to take the leap. The networking opportunities, knowledge gained, and motivation boost are well worth the investment. Start looking for conferences in your area or plan a trip to one in a new city!
