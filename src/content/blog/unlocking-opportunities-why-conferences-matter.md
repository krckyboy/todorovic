A week ago, my team and I embarked on a journey to the heart of Transylvania - [Cluj, Romania](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rgZgvkRtt1cfMTR8A), to participate in the [JSHeroes 2024](https://jsheroes.io/) conference. As expected, it's a web conference tailored specifically for front-end developers.

[JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) exceeded our expectations in every way. Beyond the impressive talks, the organization's meticulous planning truly set it apart from other conferences we've attended. At a cost of 150 euros, attendees receive far more than anticipated - meals, snacks, and even ice cream, highlighting excellent value and the content was phenomenal and interesting!

## Why go to a web conference?

Attending a conference like [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) feels like stumbling upon a hidden treasure. It's not just about the latest tools or frameworks; it's about connecting with folks who share your passion for front-end development. That energy, that buzz, it's super motivating.

Conferences are like the tech equivalent of a music festival, minus the camping and questionable hygiene levels. Plus, getting out of your comfort zone and exploring new cities doesn't hurt either. You should connect with interesting people and speakers you admire. Who knows what can come out of a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dusan-todorovic-krcky/) connection? New job? New project? Collaboration? You don't know unless you try.

### Networking

At the heart of any conference lies the power of networking. Conferences bring together professionals from various backgrounds and industries, creating a fertile ground for exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and forging long-lasting connections. Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project, seek advice from seasoned veterans, or simply expand your professional network, conferences offer countless opportunities to meet and interact with like-minded individuals.

So, in order to connect with speakers I admired, what did I do? Well, I approached them in the right time (not when they are talking on the stage!) when they are free and tell them what you think of the talk, ask them questions and ask if they want to connect on social media. I've never had a bad experience when I engaged in a conversation with a speaker (in any conference that I've been to).

If you're shy or you simply didn't have an opportunity to reach out to your favorite speaker during the conference, find them online on LinkedIn, Instagram, or whichever platform they're on and just say hi. I guarantee that the worst thing that could happen is them not responding because they are either super busy or they haven't seen the message (yet), but in most cases they will be glad that you reach out to them. They also want to connect with other people, trust me.

### Learning from the best

Another key benefit of attending a conference like [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) is the chance to learn from the best in the industry. The conference features talks and workshops delivered by renowned experts who are not only knowledgeable but also passionate about their work. Their insights can spark new ideas, challenge your current beliefs, and equip you with cutting-edge skills that can immediately impact your projects. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking to deepen your expertise, JSHeroes caters to a wide range of learning needs.

Our exposure to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) through a talk by [Debbie O'Brien](https://x.com/debs_obrien), Senior Program Manager at Microsoft, last year significantly influenced our decision to adopt it for our end-to-end testing. Such practical insights underscore the value of conferences in shaping both personal and professional development.

### Boosting your motivation

Conferences can be a significant boost to your motivation. Being surrounded by individuals who are equally passionate about technology can reignite your enthusiasm for your work. The energy and positivity at such events can inspire you to push boundaries, experiment with new concepts, and approach challenges with renewed vigor. This motivational surge can carry over into your daily life and projects, driving you to achieve greater things.

### Exploring new cities

Venturing to a new city for a conference like JSHeroes adds an extra dimension of excitement and discovery. It's not just about the conference itself; it's about immersing yourself in a different culture, trying local cuisines, and experiencing the unique atmosphere of the host city. This aspect of attending JSHeroes encourages stepping out of your comfort zone, fostering creativity and openness to new ideas.

### Tips

Take notes during talks! I personally had my laptop with me and opened up notes, and started taking down whatever I thought was interesting to me. I paid extra attention to website links of the speakers so I could check them out later.

## Favorite talks of JSHeroes 2024!

I figured I should share which talks I found the most interesting and the reasoning behind that. Here are 3 that left a lasting impression:

### [Rose Akoth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rose-akoth-496407160/) - Reimagining web layout for accessible multilingual content

Rose was just amazing! Definitely my favorite speaker of the conference. Her engaging and insightful talk focused on the critical yet often overlooked area of web layout design for accessible multilingual content. Akoth's charisma and practical approach, including a live coding segment, made the session both educational and entertaining.

She adeptly explained the difference between physical and logical CSS properties, emphasizing the latter's importance in enhancing accessibility for multilingual content. By demonstrating how borders, margins, and paddings can be dynamically adjusted for languages like Arabic and Japanese, Akoth showcased the practical benefits of logical CSS properties in accommodating unique text layouts.

Her live coding demonstration was particularly impactful, allowing attendees to visually grasp how CSS properties behave differently across languages. This hands-on approach reinforced the importance of logical properties in creating universally accessible web layouts.

### [Tejas Kumar](https://tej.as/) - You are an AI engineer

Tejas Kumar kicked off the event as the first speaker, setting a high standard for the presentations that followed. His charisma and engaging delivery made the session not only informative but also highly enjoyable.

Tejas emphasized that being an AI engineer extends beyond having proficiency in mathematics and machine learning. He broadened the scope to include developers who leverage AI through APIs or indirectly in their work, highlighting the expansive nature of the AI engineering profession.

Kumar's talk shed light on the burgeoning demand for AI engineers, suggesting that the field is poised to become one of the highest-paid industries. This prediction underscores the critical role AI engineers play in harnessing artificial intelligence to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

### [Bramus Van Damme](https://bram.us/) - MPA View Transitions are here!

Bramus Van Damme's presentation on MPA View Transitions was a fascinating exploration of a cutting-edge web development feature. His talk stood out for its clarity and practicality, especially the examples that demonstrated how transitions behave under different conditions.

Van Damme's detailed explanation of MPA View Transitions, focusing on their fundamental operation as snapshots and pixel manipulations, was both enlightening and accessible. His approach to breaking down complex concepts into understandable parts made the session engaging and informative.

These demonstrations not only clarified the technical aspects but also sparked a newfound interest in exploring this topic further.
