## 1. Behavior Update

- [x] 1.1 Update related-post selection to require shared tag overlap
- [x] 1.2 Keep current/excluded slug filtering (`current`, `prev`, `next`)
- [x] 1.3 Remove recency-as-related fallback, or relabel fallback as “More Posts”

## 2. UX and Copy

- [x] 2.1 Ensure section heading reflects actual behavior
- [x] 2.2 Define zero-related-post behavior (hidden section vs separate fallback block)

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Validate behavior on posts with dense tags
- [x] 3.2 Validate behavior on posts with unique tags
- [x] 3.3 Validate no overlap with Continue Reading links
- [x] 3.4 Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
