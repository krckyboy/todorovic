# Inspiration

## Candidate Angles

1. **Angle:** Launch note with technical substance  
   Hook: "I rebuilt the site so it is easier to ship and easier to trust."  
   Why now: The new site is already in active iteration.  
   Risks: Can read like a changelog if not framed around reader value.

2. **Angle:** Workflow story (spec-first + AI)  
   Hook: "Speed from AI only matters when requirements stay explicit."  
   Why now: AI tooling is central to current engineering conversations.  
   Risks: Can feel abstract without concrete examples.

3. **Angle:** Personal editorial intro  
   Hook: "This is what I plan to write about and why."  
   Why now: Sets expectations for future readers.  
   Risks: Too generic if it avoids implementation specifics.

## Recommended Direction

- Selected angle: Hybrid of 1 + 2 + 3 (launch note anchored in workflow and future content).
- Reason for selection: Balances personal context with concrete engineering signal.
- Expected reader takeaway: This site is actively maintained, process-driven, and focused on practical engineering topics.

## Outline Candidate

1. Why rebuild
2. What changed in the stack and structure
3. How AI is used with OpenSpec guardrails
4. What readers can expect
5. Near-term roadmap and close
