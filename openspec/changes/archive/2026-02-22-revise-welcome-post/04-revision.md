# Revision

## Technical Review

- Factual corrections: constrained claims to repository-confirmed stack/workflow facts.
- Version/date clarifications: kept `pubDate` unchanged (`2026-02-16`) and avoided time-sensitive completion claims.
- Snippet validation notes: no code snippets in this post.

## Editorial Review

- Structure changes: refined section flow around context -> migration rationale -> Astro fit -> AI stance.
- Clarity and brevity edits: replaced "stack evolved" framing with explicit Git-first writing-flow rationale and Strapi overhead concerns.
- Tone adjustments: kept voice warm and natural while reducing forced emphasis punctuation.
- Warmth pass (less robotic, more natural phrasing): completed.
- Engagement punctuation pass (use `!` only where authentic): completed.

## Metadata Review

- Final title: `Welcome: Why I Rebuilt todorovic.dev`
- Final description: `A short launch note on moving from a heavier Next.js and Strapi setup to Astro, and how spec-driven development reshaped my AI-assisted workflow.`
- Final tags: `['launch', 'astro', 'openspec', 'ai-assisted-engineering']`
- Draft state decision: keep `draft: true` until manual publish decision.
