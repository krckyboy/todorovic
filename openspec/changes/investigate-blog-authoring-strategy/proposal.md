## Why

The repository has baseline blog authoring guidance, but it does not define a concrete operating model for tool choice, agent roles, and decision criteria across planning, drafting, technical validation, and publishing. A clear strategy is needed to make blog production repeatable and high quality.

## What Changes

- Research current capabilities and constraints of relevant tooling (OpenSpec workflow, Codex workflow support, markdown quality tooling).
- Define a practical agent-based authoring flow (research, technical verification, editorial refinement).
- Document recommended tool usage by phase, with explicit fallback paths.
- Add publish-readiness gates and ownership expectations for each phase.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `blog-authoring-strategy`: A documented and testable operating model for blog planning, drafting, technical validation, and publishing with AI assistance.

### Modified Capabilities

- None.

## Impact

- **Affected files**: `documentation/blog-authoring-workflow.md` and supporting documentation if needed.
- **Dependencies**: no runtime dependencies.
- **Process impact**: introduces a standardized decision framework for authoring tools and agent roles.
