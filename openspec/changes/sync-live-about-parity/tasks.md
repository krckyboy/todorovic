## 1. Baseline + Scope

- [x] 1.1 Capture live `/about` section inventory and map it to Astro equivalents

- [x] 1.3 Record copy constraints (concise, current role-aligned, scannable)

## 2. About Page Content Structure

- [x] 2.1 Add section headings to `src/pages/about.astro`: Introduction, Musical Background, Transition to Programming, Early Career, Leading, Interests
- [x] 2.2 Replace/expand current short bio copy with curated parity content under these sections
- [x] 2.3 Preserve a clear contact intent path (`Get in Touch`) and About-to-Skills wayfinding

## 3. Spec + Documentation Sync

- [x] 3.1 Add/maintain requirement deltas in `openspec/changes/sync-live-about-parity/specs/portfolio-module/spec.md`
- [x] 3.2 Keep `openspec/specs/open-proposals/spec.md` progress/status aligned for this change

## 4. Validation

- [x] 4.1 Run `npm run lint`
- [x] 4.2 Run `npm run build`
- [x] 4.3 Manually verify About page hierarchy (`h1` once, section headings ordered, links reachable by keyboard)
