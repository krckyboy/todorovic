# Proposal: Update Design

## Problem

The current design is minimal/placeholder. Need to create a polished, professional design that reflects the portfolio's purpose.

## Goals

1. Create a cohesive visual identity
2. Improve typography and spacing
3. Add visual interest (gradients, subtle animations)
4. Ensure excellent mobile experience
5. Match the style of existing todorovic.dev (or improve upon it)

## Scope

- Update global.css with refined design tokens
- Redesign Header and Navigation
- Redesign Footer
- Update page layouts (home, about, skills, blog)
- Add hero section to home page
- Create or update components as needed:
  - Skills component (for skills page)
  - Experience component (for about page)
  - AuthorCard component (for blog posts)
  - Categories component (for blog filtering)

## Out of Scope

- Dark/light theme (separate proposal)
- Search functionality (separate task)
- Content changes (separate proposal)

- Design inspiration: TBD
